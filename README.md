# EDDiscovery CSV Parser
 Elite Dangerous CSV Parser (sheets from EDDiscovery) 

I have been playing a lot more Elite Dangerous lately waiting for Odssey to come out. 

I wanted a way to easily parse lightyear jumps and be able to graph them. I am not so huge into matplotlib, but once you have a csv with the information it is easy to use any graphing software.
